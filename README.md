# High-Rate Network Traffic Analyzer for Early DDoS Detection

This project implements a distributed DDoS detection and mitigation system using MPI, statistical analysis, and machine learning. It was developed as part of the CS3006 Parallel and Distributed Computing course.

## Key Components
- MPI-based preprocessing of large-scale traffic data
- Entropy and CUSUM based anomaly detection
- Machine learning based attack classification
- RTBH and ACL/Rate-Limiting based mitigation
- Performance evaluation (latency, throughput, scalability)

## Repository Structure
- `project/` — Core implementation (MPI + ML)
- `Report.pdf` — Final project report
- `Slides.pptx` — Project presentation

## Dataset
CIC-DDoS2019 dataset was used for evaluation.  
Dataset files are not included due to size constraints.

## Technologies Used
- C with MPI
- Python (Random Forest)
- Parallel and Distributed Computing concepts
